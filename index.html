					<h1>What is <strong>ABLE/ISD</strong>?</h1>
					
					<p>You design, you learn. That's our approach. We're teaching a new generation of instructional<br> designers based on the idea that learning is doing. Our workshop, which takes place entirely<br> online wherever you are, is about putting hands-on experience at the forefront. We give you<br> the tools you need to be successful and then ask you to take the lead.</p>

						<p>Our students<br> develop 6 number of<br> projects throughout<br> our workshop and<br> discover exactly how<br> instructional design<br> works.</p>

						<p>Learn from the work<br> you do and the work<br> of others. Get help<br> from our mentors and<br> instructors when you<br> need it.</p>

						<p>Meet with a group and<br> brainstorm solutions.<br> Work together,<br>
						learn together, grow<br> together.</p>

						<h1>Our Aim</h1>
						<p>ABLE/ISD prepares you for the real world, not one of academia and research. On day one, you’ll start building the skills you<br> need to be successful in the workplace. Unlike most university programs, you’ll be doing the same work you would do in any<br> job. You won’t just build a resume, you’ll build a portfolio.</p>

						<p>What you’ll learn in this course can be applied to learning everywhere, but we’ve designed it for the corporate world. Our goal<br> is that you’ll have all the skills you need to start developing training as soon as you  nish the workshop.</p>

						<p>This workshop was designed for what’s relevant. We provide you with curated materials that get to the point, and we don’t<br> teach you everything: we want you to discover it for yourself with the ability to reach out to fellow students and mentors if you<br> get stuck. We believe that a good theory is only useful if you can apply it, so we teach a few practical principles, and invite you<br> to experiment with the rest.</p>
					</div>

					<div id="bottom-gray">
						<p id="top-left">We require that our students work<br> together; it’s rare to work alone in<br> the office, and our own success<br> often relies on the success of the<br> team.</p>

						<h1>There is no “right” or “wrong” way in<br> our workshop, so be creative!</h1>

						<p id="bottom-columns">Every learner is different;<br>working with a team will help you<br> understand that the same methods<br> don’t always work for everyone.<br> You’ll rely on your team throughout<br> the workshop, and be part of a<br> growing network of educators by<br> the end.<br> There are no grades! We<br> don’t expect you to be<br> perfect, we just expect<br> you to try your best. New<br> skills take time and practice<br> to develop, so we make<br> sure you get meaningful<br> feedback about what<br> you’re working on.<br> We think the best way to<br> get good at something<br> is to do it, so we’ve<br> designed a curriculum<br> that asks you to start<br> building now and learn<br> along the way.</p>

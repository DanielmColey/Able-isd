							<h2>The old model is failing.</h2>
							<p>Students are paying more and<br> more for a college education,<br> but when they graduate they<br> still need training before<br> they can do what they spent<br> years learning. Five years of<br> experience has become a<br> requirement for most entry<br> level positions in today’s<br> corporate environment,<br> because companies don’t want<br> to have to train new employees<br> from scratch.</p>
						</div>
						<div id="ours">
							<h2>What we do differently</h2>
							<p>ABLE/ISD gives you the skills<br> to be a successful instructional<br> systems designer from day<br> one on the job. We think the<br> best instruction leaves you<br> capable to do the job, not<br> just knowledgeable about the<br> concept.</p>
						</div>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div id="approach">
						<h1>Our Approach</h1>
						<p>No proprietary materials, no grades, and no lectures, our strategy is simple. We<br> provide you with the resources you need to complete a project. Sometimes you will<br> work with a group, and sometimes on your own. Your instructor, mentors, and fellow<br> students will be there to help, motivate, and give feedback. Together, you’ll create<br> something you would make in a corporate environment.</p>

											<h2>Who It's For</h2>
											<p>We've kept the working professional in mind, and have designed this course to be within reach of those that already have a busy schedule.<br/> That said, this course is no walk-in-the-park, and a serious time commitment is expected. But if you're looking to build practical skills in the world of education, then look no further than ABLE/ISD.</p>

													<h2>Build a Network</h2>
													<p>The world is becoming a more connected place, and the answers to many of our problems have probably already been solved by another person.<br /> Connecting with others has become one of the most effective problem solving strategies. You'll build a network throughout this course that you can rely on and turn to for help and advice.</p>

												<h2>No Propietary Materials</h2>
												<p>Knowledge is free these days. From articles, to books, to MOOCs, education can be obtained for the price of an internet connection.<br /> ABLE/ISD is about building the right skills and using the information that is already available. We don't have lectures, handouts, or secrets. We understand that the best education is a practical one, and that's exactly what we've set out to do.</p>

										<h2 class="text">Tuition</h2>
										<span class="popuptext" id="myPopup4">
											<h2>Tuition</h2>
											<p>Tuition for the course is $2,500 dollars and is non-refundable. Four reference books are included.<br /> One of the keys of ABLE/ISD is vested interest. We want you to take this course seriously, for yourself and for the people you will be working with.</p>

										<img class="image" src="assets/images/library.png">
										<h2 class="text">Corporate<br> Focus</h2>
										<span class="popuptext" id="myPopup5">
											<h2>Corporate Focus</h2>
											<p>While designing ABLE/ISD, we asked ourselves how to make this the most valuable course available. We think that the most important objective of education should be employability.<br /> For this reason, we've decided to focus on corporate training, but the information can be applied to all aspects of learning.</p>

											<h2>No Grades</h2>
											<p>Good news: you won't be expected to pass a test or memorize theory. Our jobs are not a closed-book test; you are always free to look up what you don't know.<br /> We encourage you to experiment to find solutions that work for you, and there are no wrong answers.</p>

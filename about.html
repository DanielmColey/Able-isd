					<h1>About the program</h1>

					<div id="old_new">
						<h2>The Old Model is Failing</h2>
						<h2>What we do differently</h2>
					</div>
						<p>Students are paying more and<br> more for a college education,<br> but when they graduate they<br> still need training before<br> they can do what they spent<br> years learning. Five years of<br> experience has become a<br> requirement for most entry<br> level positions in today’s<br> corporate environment,<br> because companies don’t want<br> to have to train new employees<br> from scratch.</p>
						<p>ABLE/ISD gives you the skills<br> to be a successful instructional<br> systems designer from day<br> one on the job. We think the<br> best instruction leaves you<br> capable to do the job, not<br> just knowledgeable about the<br> concept.</p>
				</div>

				<div id="approach">
						<h1>Our Approach</h1>
						<p>No proprietary materials, no grades, and no lectures, our strategy is simple. We<br> provide you with the resources you need to complete a project. Sometimes you will<br> work with a group, and sometimes on your own. Your instructor, mentors, and fellow<br> students will be there to help, motivate, and give feedback. Together, you’ll create<br> something you would make in a corporate environment.</p>

That<br> said, this course is no walk-in-the-park, and a serious time commitment is<br> expected. But if you're looking to build practical skills in the world of<br> education, then look no further than ABLE/ISD.</p>

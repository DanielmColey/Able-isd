          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What is ABLE/ISD?</h5>
          				<p>ABLE/ISD is an online Instructional Development Design workshop. <br><br> Developed and driven by training executive, Kristy Bloxham PhD, the ABLE/ISD program uses on-line tools to engage you with a group of other students in an intense six-week learning experience. Students from all over the world are welcome to participate. <br><br>Each instructional design concept presented during the workshop is enforced by a real life project the students will complete either individually, or with a group. These projects will give you experience that will help build your body of work. <br><br> This program has assignment deadlines, and regular group meetings, which take place online through video calls. <br><br> The weekly group meeting schedule is Monday, Wednesday, and Friday 7-9pm MT. Students use other hours for individual work. These meeting times are non-optional and real-time with other students. Tuition is $2,400.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What are the important dates and deadlines?</h5>

                  </div>
                  <h5 class="tuition_headers">Why is there an early registration date?</h5>

                  <p>Early applicants are given priority in the admissions process. We reward that enthusiasm for learning.<br><br>The other benefit is that we offer rolling admissions for early applicants. If you submit your application by the Priority Registration deadline, you'll receive your admission decision as it is processed, rather than waiting until the regular decision release date.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">How do I apply to ABLE/ISD?</h5>
          				<p>After reading this FAQ, you can find the application <a href="form_page.html">here.</a></p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What is the schedule like?</h5>
          				<p>Students will meet for two hours twice per week, on Tuesday and Thursday. Projects are due Mondays and Thursdays at noon, with new projects released on those same mornings.<br> After projects are completed, you will review fellow students' work and provide feedback. This is due the next day by midnight.<br><br> Monday: new project released, previous project due at noon<br>Tuesday: group meeting 7-9pm MT, project feedback due at midnight<br>Wednesday: solo work time<br>Thursday: group meeting 7-9pm MT, project released, previous project due at noon<br>Friday: project feedback due at midnight<br>Saturday: instructor feedback released, solo work time<br>Sunday: solo work time</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What is the curriculum like?</h5>

          				<p>Real work is based on accomplishing something that benefits others. Our curriculum is based on those types of real world projects. Principles of Project/Problem Based Learning have shown dramatic increases in student learning outcomes so why wouldn't we want to teach that way?  Together, students learn to analyze, create, and deliver. We believe the best learning comes from thinking through problems, collaborating with others, and jointly deciding a course of action. Together, we all go up.<br><br>We guide you through this rigorous program while allowing you to find your strengths within your groups. Much like the workforce of today, you will learn to work with and learn from others. Group work is required, but so are your thinking caps. Bring your past experiences to help your fellow students while learning from them as well.<br><br>We use Slack, Google Apps, and Facebook to create connection between class members allowing you to experience this collaborative working environment.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">Who should enroll?</h5>
          				<p>The goal of the ABLE/ISD program is to assemble innovators, connect them, and amplify their work, without leaving home, in just 6-weeks of intense effort.<br><br> We're not trying to make you an expert in any single skill or specialization. We focus on a well-rounded skill set that allows you to decide where to take your career from there. We teach learning principles, and the full array of processes that are needed to develop effective instruction.<br><br>This workshop is for people that want to understand how to develop instruction, and who want to get started immediately.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">How much does it cost?</h5>
          				<p>The cost is $2,400. Along with the time spent, this is a significant investment.<br><br>ABLE/ISD is a serious commitment. We look for people who are serious about their education and what they can do with their futures. Our mentors spend a significant amount of time making sure you have what you need to continue on and be successful. This is not a MOOC (massive open online course).</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">Is there an application fee?</h5>
          				<p>No, there is no fee to apply to ABLE/ISD.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What are the requirements to be admitted?</h5>
          				<p>We're seeking people of all ages, from all backgrounds (as long as your English is solid), who want to change themselves and change learning as we know it. Although being a digital native is not required, a healthy background in using online social media tools would help. You must have access to a computer along with a webcam, a good internet connection, and a strong work ethic.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">Is the program open to participants from outside North America?</h5>
          				<p>Yes, as long as your English is good, you are aware of the timezone differences, and you are able to meet during the scheduled times.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What kind of support do you offer students?</h5>
          				<p>With an active team of your own and direct access to mentors and the instructor, our goal is to guide you through the work—not force you to muddle through the problems. You'll get feedback and guidance on your projects and discover new ways to think about the typical problems you're faced with in an everyday work environment.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What is your class attendance policy?	</h5>
          				<p>ABLE/ISD is about working together. We expect students to commit to the workshop, their teams, and themselves. You will need to be fully present for the success of yourself and those around you.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">Will the course follow the curriculum of a standard ISD program?</h5>
          				<p>While the content will be similar, this workshop is built on action. Standard programs are built heavily on theory with very little application. Many are also built for only face-to-face types of delivery. We have built our program to add all of the current trends and technology that are having a meaningful effect on training today. You can expect to learn many of the same things, but you can also expect to be applying them to your projects as you learn them.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">What is the usual class size?</h5>
          				<p>Currently, we limit the size to just 20 students. Individual teams are composed of 5 students, and these groups rotate every two weeks. We keep it small to keep our students engaged, and to ensure that we are able to give every student plenty of opportunity for coaching and feedback.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">How much time can I expect to spend on coursework each day?</h5>
          				<p>The short answer is: a lot.<br><br>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, students meet for 2 hours to discuss the current projects and to share what they've learned with the rest of their team. The time between these meetings is for solo work, and assignments are due twice per week.</p>

          				<h5 class="tuition_headers">Who teaches the course?</h5>
          				<p>Kristy Bloxham, PhD is the instructor for the course. Depending on class size, other qualified mentors may help to coach specific topics of expertise. Kristy has a PhD in Instructional Technology and Learning Sciences from Utah State University and has spent many years working in a corporate environment designing and building training programs. She will work alongside you as you define your career objectives, making sure you focus on specific skills attainment. Her desire for your success is evident in the way the class is designed. This is not an online video course, but a true online learning experience led by a well-known professional in the field of Instructional Design.</p>

Your mentor will work with you before and during the course to help you get the most out of your learning and career goals. Our job is to be dedicated to you, and your job is to be dedicated to yourself. This commitment includes the time and money you will have to invest into taking and completing the workshop.</p>

          				<p>We accept all major credit cards, as well as Paypal.</p>

A $500 dollar portion is a non-refundable deposit, but for up to 14 days before the start of your session you can request a refund on the remaining $2000 dollar amount.<br><br> In the event that you must withdraw from the workshop, we ask that you let us know as soon as possible so that we can try to fill your spot.</p>
